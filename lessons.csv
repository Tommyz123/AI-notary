No,Title,Content
001,Professional Conduct,"Use of the office of notary in other than the specific, step-by-step procedure required is viewed as a serious offense by the Secretary of State. The practice of taking acknowledgments and affidavits over the telephone, or otherwise, without the actual, personal appearance of the individual making the acknowledgment or affidavit before the officiating notary, is illegal.

The attention of all notaries public is called to the following judicial declarations concerning such misconduct:

?The court again wishes to express its condemnation of the acts of notaries taking acknowledgments or affidavits without the presence of the party whose acknowledgment is taken for the affiant, and that it will treat serious professional misconduct the act of any notary thus violating his official duty.? (Matter of Napolis, 169 App. Div. 469, 472.)

?Upon the faith of these acknowledgments rests the title of real property, and the only security to such titles is the fidelity with which notaries and commissioners of deeds perform their duty in requiring the appearance of parties to such instruments before them and always refusing to execute a certificate unless the parties are actually known to them or the identity of the parties executing the instruments is satisfactorily proved.? (Matter of Gottheim, 153 App. Div. 779, 782.)

Equally unacceptable to the Secretary of State is slipshod administration of oaths. The simplest form in which an oath may be lawfully administered is:

?Do you solemnly swear that the contents of this affidavit subscribed by you is correct and true?? (Bookman v. City of New York, 200 N.Y. 53, 56.)

Alternatively, the following affirmation may be used for persons who conscientiously decline taking an oath. This affirmation is legally equivalent to an oath and is just as binding:

?Do you solemnly, sincerely and truly declare and affirm that the statements made by you are true and correct??

Whatever the form adopted, it must be in the presence of an officer authorized to administer it, and it must be an unequivocal and present act by which the affiant consciously takes upon himself the obligation of an oath. (Idem, citing People ex rel. Kenyon v. Sutherland, 81 N.Y. 1; O?Reilly v. People, 86 N.Y. 154, 158, 161.)

Unless a lawyer, the notary public may not engage directly or indirectly in the practice of law. Listed below are some of the activities involving the practice of law which are prohibited, and which subject the notary public to removal from office by the Secretary of State, and possible imprisonment, fine or both. A notary:

1. May not give advice on the law. The notary may not draw any kind of legal papers, such as wills, deeds, bills of sale, mortgages, chattel mortgages, contracts, leases, offers, options, incorporation papers, releases, mechanics liens, power of attorney, complaints and all legal pleadings, papers in summary proceedings to evict a tenant, or in bankruptcy, affidavits, or any papers which our courts have said are legal documents or papers.

2. May not ask for and get legal business to send to a lawyer or lawyers with whom he has any business connection or from whom he receives any money or other consideration for sending the business.

3. May not divide or agree to divide his fees with a lawyer, or accept any part of a lawyer?s fee on any legal business.

4. May not advertise in, or circulate in any manner, any paper or advertisement, or say to anyone that he has any powers or rights not given to the notary by the laws under which the notary was appointed.

A notary public is cautioned not to execute an acknowledgment of the execution of a will. Such acknowledgment cannot be deemed equivalent to an attestation clause accompanying a will.

002,§130. Appointment of notaries public,"1. The Secretary of State may appoint and commission as many notaries public for the State of New York as in his or her judgment may be deemed best, whose jurisdiction shall be co-extensive with the boundaries of the state.

A notary public who is a resident of the State and who moves out of the state but still maintains a place of business or an office in New York State does not vacate his or her office as a notary public. A notary public who is a nonresident and who ceases to have an office or place of business in this state, vacates his or her office as a notary public. A notary public who is a resident of New York State and moves out of the state and who does not retain an office or place of business in this State shall vacate his or her office as a notary public. A non-resident who accepts the office of notary public in this State thereby appoints the Secretary of State as the person upon whom process can be served on his or her behalf. Before issuing to any applicant a commission as notary public, unless he or she be an attorney and counselor at law duly admitted to practice in this state or a court clerk of the Unified Court System who has been appointed to such position after taking a Civil Service promotional examination in the court clerk series of titles, the Secretary of State shall satisfy himself or herself that the applicant is of good moral character, has the equivalent of a common school education and is familiar with the duties and responsibilities of a notary public; provided, however, that where a notary public applies, before the expiration of his or her term, for reappointment with the county clerk or where a person whose term as notary public shall have expired applies within 6 months thereafter for reappointment as a notary public with the county clerk, such qualifying requirements may be waived by the Secretary of State, and further, where an application for reappointment is filed with the county clerk after the expiration of the aforementioned renewal period by a person who failed or was unable to re-apply by reason of his or her induction or enlistment in the armed forces of the United States, such qualifying requirements may also be waived by the Secretary of State, provided such application for reappointment is made within a period of 1 year after the military discharge of the applicant under conditions other than dishonorable. In any case, the appointment or reappointment of any applicant is in the discretion of the Secretary of State. The Secretary of State may suspend or remove from office, for misconduct, any notary public appointed by him or her but no such removal shall be made unless the person who is sought to be removed shall have been served with a copy of the charges against him or her and have an opportunity of being heard. No person shall be appointed as a notary public under this article who has been convicted, in this State or any other state or territory, of a crime, unless the secretary makes a finding in conformance with all applicable statutory requirements, including those contained in article twenty-three-A of the correction law, that such convictions do not constitute a bar to appointment.

2. A person regularly admitted to practice as an attorney and counselor in the courts of record of this state, whose office for the practice of law is within the State, may be appointed a notary public and retain his office as such notary public although he resides in or removes to an adjoining state.

"
007,"§3-200 and 3-400. Election Law.

012,Notary public?disqualifications.,"Though a person may be eligible to hold the office of notary the person may be disqualified to act in certain cases by reason of having an interest in the case. To state the rule broadly: if the notary is a party to or directly and pecuniarily interested in the transaction, the person is not capable of acting in that case. For example, a notary who is a grantee or mortgagee in a conveyance or mortgage is disqualified to take the acknowledgment of the grantor or mortgagor; likewise a notary who is a trustee in a deed of trust; and, of course, a notary who is the grantor could not take his own acknowledgment. A notary beneficially interested in the conveyance by way of being secured thereby is not competent to take the acknowledgment of the instrument. In New York the courts have held an acknowledgment taken by a person financially or beneficially interested in a party to conveyance or instrument of which it is a part to be a nullity; and that the acknowledgment of an assignment of a mortgage before one of the assignees is a nullity; and that an acknowledgment by one of the incorporators of the other incorporators who signed a certificate was of no legal effect."
013,§134. Signature and seal of county clerk.,"The signature and seal of a county clerk, upon a certificate of official character of a notary public or the signature of a county clerk upon a certificate of authentication of the signature and acts of a notary public or commissioner of deeds, may be a facsimile, printed, stamped, photographed or engraved thereon."

A notary public who is an attorney at law regularly admitted to practice in this State may, in his discretion, administer an oath or affirmation to or take the affidavit or acknowledgment of his client in respect of any matter, claim, action or proceeding.

For any misconduct by a notary public in the performance of any of his powers such notary public shall be liable to the parties injured for all damages sustained by them. A notary public shall not, directly or indirectly, demand or receive for the protest for the non-payment of any note, or for the non-acceptance or non-payment of any bill of exchange, check or draft and giving the requisite notices and certificates of such protest, including his notarial seal, if affixed thereto, any greater fee or reward than 75 cents for such protest, and 10 cents for each notice, not exceeding five, on any bill or note.

?I am not an attorney licensed to practice law and may not give legal advice about immigration or any other legal matter or accept fees for legal advice.?

3. A notary public shall not use terms in a foreign language in any advertisement for his or her services as a notary public that mean or imply that the notary public is an attorney licensed to practice in the state of New York or in any jurisdiction of the United States. The secretary shall designate by rule or regulation the terms in a foreign language that shall be deemed to mean or imply that a notary public is licensed to practice law in the state of New York and the use of which shall be prohibited by notary publics who are subject to this section.

064,Acknowledgment,"A formal declaration before a duly authorized officer by a person who has executed an instrument that such execution is his act and deed.
Technically, an acknowledgment is the declaration of a person described in and who has executed a written instrument, that he executed the same.
As commonly used, the term means the certificate of an officer, duly empowered to take an acknowledgment or proof of the conveyance of real property, that
on a specified date before me came ....................., to me known to be the individual described in and who executed the foregoing instrument and acknowledged that he executed the same.
The purposes of the law respecting acknowledgments are not only to promote the security of land titles and to prevent frauds in conveyancing, but to furnish proof of the due execution of conveyances (Armstrong v. Combs, 15 App. Div. 246) so as to permit the document to be given in evidence, without further proof of its execution, and make it a recordable instrument."
065,The Real Property Law prescribes:,"§303. Requisites of acknowledgments.
An acknowledgment must not be taken by any officer unless he knows or has satisfactory evidence, that the person making it is the person described in and who executed such instrument.

The thing to be known is the identity of the person making the acknowledgment with the person described in the instrument and the person who executed the same.
This knowledge must be possessed by the notary (Gross v. Rowley, 147 App. Div. 529), and a notary must not take an acknowledgment unless the notary knows or has proof that the person making it is the person described in and who executed the instrument (People v. Kempner, 49 App. Div. 121).
It is not essential that the person who executed the instrument sign his name in the presence of the notary.

Taking acknowledgments over the telephone is illegal and a notary public is guilty of a misdemeanor in so acting.
In the certificate of acknowledgment, a notary public declares: On this ....... day of ............ 20 ......., before me came ............ to me known, etc.
Unless the person purporting to have made the acknowledgment actually and personally appeared before the notary on the day specified, the notarys certificate that he so came is palpably false and fraudulent. (Matter of Brooklyn Bar Assoc., 225 App. Div. 680.)"
066,Interest as a disqualification,"A notary public should not take an acknowledgment to a legal instrument to which the notary is a party in interest.
(Armstrong v. Combs, 15 App. Div. 246.)"
067,"Fraudulent certificates of acknowledgment
","A notary public who knowingly makes a false certificate that a deed or other written instrument was acknowledged by a party thereto is guilty of forgery in the second degree, which is punishable by imprisonment for a term of not exceeding 7 years (Penal Law, §§170.10 and 70.00[2][d]).
The essence of the crime is false certification, intention to defraud. (People v. Abeel, 182 NY 415.)

While the absence of guilty knowledge or criminal intent would absolve the notary from criminal liability, the conveyance, of which the false certification is an essential part, is a forgery and, therefore, invalid. (Caccioppoli v. Lemmo, 152 App. Div. 650.)"
068,Damages recoverable from notary for false certificate,"Action for damages sustained where notary certified that mortgagor had appeared and acknowledged a mortgage.
(Kainz v. Goldsmith, 231 App. Div. 171.)"
069,Administrator,A person appointed by the court to manage the estate of a deceased person who left no will.
070,Affiant,"The person who makes and subscribes his signature to an affidavit.

"
071,Affidavit,"An affidavit is a signed statement, duly sworn to, by the maker thereof, before a notary public or other officer authorized to administer oaths. The venue, or county wherein the affidavit was sworn to should be accurately stated. But it is of far more importance that the affiant, the person making the affidavit, should have personally appeared before the notary and have made oath to the statements contained in the affidavit as required by law.
Under the Penal Law (§210.00) the wilful making of a false affidavit is perjury, but to sustain an indictment therefor, there must have been, in some form, in the presence of an officer authorized to administer an oath, an unequivocal and present act by which the affiant consciously took upon himself the obligation of an oath; his silent delivery of a signed affidavit to the notary for his certificate, is not enough. (People v. OReilly, 86 NY 154; People ex rel. Greene v. Swasey, 122 Misc. 388; People v. Levitas (1963) 40 Misc. 2d 331.)
A notary public will be removed from office for preparing and taking the oath of an affiant to a statement that the notary knew to be false. (Matter of Senft, August 8, 1929; Matter of Trotta, February 20, 1930; Matter of Kibbe, December 24, 1931.)

The distinction between the taking of an acknowledgment and an affidavit must be clearly understood.
In the case of an acknowledgment, the notary public certifies as to the identity and execution of a document; the affidavit involves the administration of an oath to the affiant.
There are certain acknowledgment forms which are a combination of an acknowledgment and affidavit.
It is incumbent on the notary public to scrutinize each document presented to him and to ascertain the exact nature of the notarys duty with relation thereto.
An affidavit differs from a deposition in that an affidavit is an ex parte statement.
(See definition of Deposition.)"
072,Affirmation,"A solemn declaration made by persons who conscientiously decline taking an oath; it is equivalent to an oath and is just as binding; if a person has religious or conscientious scruples against taking an oath, the notary public should have the person affirm.
The following is a form of affirmation: Do you solemnly, sincerely, and truly, declare and affirm that the statements made by you are true and correct."

An oath must be administered as required by law.

110,Signature of Notary Public,"A notary public must sign the name under which he was appointed and no other.
